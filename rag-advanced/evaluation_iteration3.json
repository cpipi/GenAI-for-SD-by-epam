However, the answer cites specific source documents (Q1-Q4 2024 Market Analysis reports) that cannot be verified as actually provided in the context, which introduces a minor concern about source attribution accuracy. Despite this caveat, the core factual claim aligns perfectly with the expected answer, and the structured presentation with quarterly breakdown adds useful context. The answer achieves full marks across all three criteria given the straightforward nature of the query and the direct match with expected output."
