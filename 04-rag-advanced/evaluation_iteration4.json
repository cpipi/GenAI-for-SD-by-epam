The completeness score (25/30) is slightly reduced because while the answer provides the requested figure, the caveat about uncertainty regarding whether this is quarterly-only or year-to-date suggests incomplete confidence in the source material interpretation—ideally, this ambiguity should be definitively resolved. The relevance score (28/30) is high as the answer directly addresses the query with appropriate context and sourcing, though the uncertainty note slightly diminishes focus. The answer demonstrates good practice by citing the source and acknowledging interpretive limitations, but these caveats suggest the underlying documentation may not have been entirely clear, preventing a perfect score. Overall, this is a strong response that delivers the correct information with appropriate transparency about any remaining uncertainties."

However, it introduces significant confusion by presenting an alternative 84.3% figure from a different source without clear guidance on which to trust. While the transparency about discrepancies shows analytical rigor, the query asked for a single, definitive answer. The answer is technically accurate regarding the primary figure but undermines confidence by elevating an alternative interpretation to equal prominence. The extensive documentation of the discrepancy, while thorough, goes beyond what was requested and may confuse rather than clarify. For a straightforward factual query, a direct statement of 78.6% with brief notation of the source would have been more appropriate."
